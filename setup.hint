ldesc: "The successor to LBreakout offers you a new challenge in more 
than 50 levels with loads of new bonuses (goldshower, joker, explosive 
balls, bonus magnet ...), maluses (chaos, darkness, weak balls, malus 
magnet ...) and special bricks (growing bricks, explosive bricks, 
regenerative bricks ...). If you are hungry for more you can create your 
own levelsets with the integrated level editor."
